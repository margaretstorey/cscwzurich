Summer School on CSCW as the University of Zurich, June 25th 2015

Hosting course materials here: readings and slides. 

### Other channels we will use include:

Google docs to store topic summaries by each group (we will add links to Slack on each channel and later to GitHub)

Slack will be used throughout the day for ongoing discussion and to discuss ongoing tasks (central for today)
